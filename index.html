        <p class="text-left"><b>Search engine:</b> Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.<br>
        <b>Advertising:</b> Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017.<br>
        <b>Enterprise services:</b> Google Workspace, (formerly G Suite until October 2020) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.<br>
        <b>Internet services:</b> In February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.</p>
